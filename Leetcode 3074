# Leetcode 3074 - Apple Redistribution into Boxes
Problem Statement
You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.

There are n packs where the ith pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the ith box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.

Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.

Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.

 

Example 1:

Input: apple = [1,3,2], capacity = [4,3,1,5,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: We will use boxes with capacities 4 and 5.
It is possible to distribute the apples as the total capacity is greater than or equal to the total number of apples.

code
class Solution:
    def minimumBoxes(self, apple: List[int], capacity: List[int]) -> int:
        box = 0
        total_apple = sum(apple)
        capacity.sort(reverse=True)
        for i in capacity:
            total_apple -= i
            box+=1
            if total_apple <= 0:
                return box
